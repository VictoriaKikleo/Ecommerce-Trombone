    artDescription: "Lou Gebleux was born on December 8, 1999 in a town north of Paris. A hypersensitive and creative child, she grew up in a loving family who encouraged her to express her sensitivity and creativity, particularly through drawing. In 2008, she was hospitalized for the discovery of type 1 diabetes. Accepting the illness, the hospitalization nonetheless left her with painful memories, leading her years later into a deep depression. It wasn't until 2022, during this famous depression, that Lou began painting. Painting gave her a new zest for life, and has since become a real passion. Today, the young artist is gradually developing her artistic universe, blending realism, abstraction, color and contrast.",
